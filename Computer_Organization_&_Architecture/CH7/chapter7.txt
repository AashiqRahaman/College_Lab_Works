Section 7.1: Modeling Scalar Storage Devices

7.1.1 How does a Verilog model for a D-flip-flop handle treating reset as the highest priority input?

A Verilog model for a D-flip-flop handles reset as the highest priority input by checking 
the reset condition first in the procedural block. This is typically done using an if-else 
statement where the condition for reset is checked before any other conditions, ensuring that 
if the reset is asserted, it takes precedence over all other operations​

​.

7.1.2 For a Verilog model of a D-flip-flop with a synchronous enable (EN), why isn’t 
EN listed in the sensitivity list?

EN is not listed in the sensitivity list because the sensitivity list of a procedural 
block for a D-flip-flop with synchronous operations typically only includes the clock 
and reset signals. The synchronous enable (EN) is checked within the procedural block, 
under the clock edge condition, to control whether the D-flip-flop should capture the input data​

​.

7.1.3 For a Verilog model of a D-flip-flop with a synchronous enable (EN), what is the 
impact of listing EN in the sensitivity list?

Listing EN in the sensitivity list of a Verilog model for a D-flip-flop with a synchronous 
enable would cause the procedural block to trigger not only on clock edges but also on 
changes to the EN signal. This is incorrect for synchronous design and could lead to 
unintended behavior because the procedural block should only be triggered by clock edges 
and possibly reset conditions, not by the enable signal itself​

​.

7.1.4 For a Verilog model of a D-flip-flop with a synchronous enable (EN), 
why is the behavior of the enable modeled using a nested if-else statement 
under the else clause handling the logic for the clock edge input?

The behavior of the enable (EN) is modeled using a nested if-else statement 
under the else clause that handles the clock edge input to ensure that the 
enable condition is only checked when a clock edge occurs. This means that 
the D-flip-flop will only change state if the enable signal is active during a 
clock edge, maintaining proper synchronous behavior​

Section 7.2: Modeling Registers

7.2.1 In register transfer level modeling, how does the width of the register 
relate to the number of D-flip-flops that will be synthesized?

In register transfer level (RTL) modeling, the width of the register directly 
corresponds to the number of D-flip-flops that will be synthesized. For example, 
an 8-bit register will be synthesized into eight D-flip-flops, each storing one bit of the register's data​

​.

7.2.2 In register transfer level modeling, how is the synchronous data movement 
managed if all registers are using the same clock?

In RTL modeling, synchronous data movement is managed by using the same 
clock signal for all registers. Each register has its own enable signal, 
which controls when it should capture the input data. On every clock edge, 
each register checks its enable signal to decide whether to latch the new 
data or retain the old value, allowing for coordinated data movement across the system​

7.2.3 Design a Verilog RTL model of a 32-bit, synchronous register. 
The block diagram for the port definition is shown in Fig. 7.1. 
The register has a synchronous enable. The register should be modeled using a single procedural block.

verilog

module reg32 (
    input wire clk,
    input wire reset,
    input wire en,
    input wire [31:0] d,
    output reg [31:0] q
);
    always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
        if (reset) begin
            q <= 32'b0;
        end else if (en) begin
            q <= d;
        end
    end
endmodule

7.2.4 Design a Verilog RTL model of an 8-stage, 16-bit shift register. 
The block diagram for the port definition is shown in Fig. 7.2. 
Each stage of the shift register will be provided as an output of the system (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H).
 The shift register should be modeled using a single procedural block.

verilog

module shift_reg16 (
    input wire clk,
    input wire reset,
    input wire [15:0] d,
    output reg [15:0] A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H
);
    reg [15:0] stage [0:7];

    always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
        if (reset) begin
            stage[0] <= 16'b0;
            stage[1] <= 16'b0;
            stage[2] <= 16'b0;
            stage[3] <= 16'b0;
            stage[4] <= 16'b0;
            stage[5] <= 16'b0;
            stage[6] <= 16'b0;
            stage[7] <= 16'b0;
        end else begin
            stage[0] <= d;
            stage[1] <= stage[0];
            stage[2] <= stage[1];
            stage[3] <= stage[2];
            stage[4] <= stage[3];
            stage[5] <= stage[4];
            stage[6] <= stage[5];
            stage[7] <= stage[6];
        end
    end

    assign A = stage[0];
    assign B = stage[1];
    assign C = stage[2];
    assign D = stage[3];
    assign E = stage[4];
    assign F = stage[5];
    assign G = stage[6];
    assign H = stage[7];
endmodule

7.2.5 Design a Verilog RTL model of the multi-drop bus topology in Fig. 7.3. 
Each of the 16-bit registers (RegA, RegB, RegC, and RegD) will latch the contents of 
the 16-bit data bus if their enable line is asserted. Each register should be modeled using an 
individual procedural block.

verilog

module bus_topology (
    input wire clk,
    input wire reset,
    input wire [15:0] data_bus,
    input wire A_EN, B_EN, C_EN, D_EN,
    output reg [15:0] RegA, RegB, RegC, RegD
);
    always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
        if (reset) begin
            RegA <= 16'b0;
            RegB <= 16'b0;
            RegC <= 16'b0;
            RegD <= 16'b0;
        end else begin
            if (A_EN) RegA <= data_bus;
            if (B_EN) RegB <= data_bus;
            if (C_EN) RegC <= data_bus;
            if (D_EN) RegD <= data_bus;
        end
    end
endmodule
